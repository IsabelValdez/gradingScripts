# This is a repo with grading scrpts for mech 105 matlab assignments
# The idea with these is that the GradingScript.m is supposed to be generalized.
# Its main purpose is to look in a directory full of assignment files, loop
# over all of them, correct the canvas file names to the assignemnt file name,
# and handle data output. So in theory the only things that need changed in it
# are the location to look in and assingment file name, and the grading file
# to use.
# Files of the type homeworkGrader.m will need to be used to actually assign
# test and assign a grade for a given homework. These can assume that it is
# only testing one file with the correct function name, and need to return a
# score and a string of notes about grading.
